# Common Package

This package contains shared TypeScript types and DTOs used by both the client and server in the React Fullstack App.

## Usage
- Import types from this package in both the frontend and backend to ensure type safety and consistency.

## Scripts
- `npm run build` – Builds the TypeScript files to `dist/`.
- `npm run watch` – Watches for changes and rebuilds automatically.
- `npm run clean` – Cleans the build output.

## Notes
- Make sure to build this package before building or running the client or server.
- Update types here to propagate changes across the fullstack app.
